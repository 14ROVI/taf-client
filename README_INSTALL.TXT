Downlord's TA Forever Client (www.taforever.com)

(Adapted from Downlord's Forged Alliance Forever Client, thanks FAF guys! - www.faforever.com)

STEPS TO GET UP AND RUNNING

- extract this archive to a folder of your choosing.  Lets assume you choose d:\games\taf-client
- go to d:\games\taf-client\natives\gpgnet4a and install vcredist_x86.exe.  This is required in order to launch TA from within the TAF client
- run d:\games\taf-client\downlords-taf-client.exe
- login or create an account (see below)
- click the menu icon (top left, three horizontal bars), choose Settings, Total Annihilation
- you should see an empty table to column headings "Mod", "installed Path", "Command Line Options".  Click anywhere on that table
- in the folder explorer that pops up, go find your copy of Total Annihilation Core Contingency (TACC)
  Typical locations are:
    c:\cavedog\totala
    d:\cavedog\totala
    ${HOME}\GOG Games\Total Annihilation
    ${HOME}\steam\SteamLibrary\SteamApps\common\Total Annihilation
  click "Select Folder" when you've opened the TACC folder.
- leave Command Line Format for Executable blank unless you know what you're doing
- close Settings
- click on "Play" on the top menu to play games
- if you choose one of the other game types (TAESC, TAZERO, TAMAYHEM), you'll be prompted to locate their installation folders similarly to TACC.
- after playing enough hit "Chat" to go complain with other players about how broken Pels are
